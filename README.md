# Unclosed HTML Tag Error

This repository demonstrates a common HTML error: an unclosed tag.  Unclosed tags can lead to unexpected behavior and layout issues in web pages.

The `bug.html` file contains the erroneous code with an unclosed div element, while `bugSolution.html` provides the corrected version. This simple example highlights the importance of carefully checking your HTML for proper tag closure.
