<p>This is a common error in HTML, but it can be difficult to track down.  It occurs when you have an unclosed tag in your HTML file.  For example:</p><pre><code>&lt;div&gt;This is some text&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre><p>The above HTML is missing a closing tag for the &lt;div&gt; element, which can cause unexpected rendering issues, layout problems, and in some cases, it can prevent the page from rendering correctly.  Browsers try to interpret the code, but without the proper closing tag, they may interpret subsequent elements incorrectly.</p>
